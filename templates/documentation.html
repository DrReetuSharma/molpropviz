        <p>This web application is designed to calculate a range of essential molecular properties from SMILES data. Researchers, scientists, and drug developers can use this tool to quickly assess the molecular characteristics of their compounds in a user-friendly and efficient manner.</p>

        <p>Input file to be uploaded should be in csv format with first and second column as ID and SMILES, respectively.</p>

        <h3>Properties Calculated by the Web App:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Molecular Weight (MolWt)</strong>: Measures the total mass of a molecule, essential for understanding its solubility and stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Number of Rings (NumRings)</strong>: Provides insight into the structural complexity and rigidity of the molecule.</li>
            <li><strong>Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)</strong>: Reflects the molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds and its interaction with biological targets.</li>
            <li><strong>Molecular LogP (MolLogP)</strong>: Indicates the hydrophobicity of the molecule, affecting its absorption and distribution in the body.</li>
            <li><strong>Number of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (NumHAcceptors)</strong>: A critical factor in drug-receptor binding interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Number of Hydrogen Bond Donors (NumHDonors)</strong>: Affects drug solubility and interaction with biological systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy Atom Count (HeavyAtomCount)</strong>: Gives an estimate of molecular complexity, influencing various physicochemical properties.</li>
            <li><strong>Exact Molecular Weight (ExactMolWt)</strong>: Provides the precise molecular mass, crucial for mass spectrometry analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Bertz Conjectural Topological Index (BertzCT)</strong>: A measure of molecular complexity, related to molecular stability and reactivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Chi0 and Chi1 (Connectivity Indices)</strong>: Important for understanding the molecule's topology and its reactivity patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Number of OH Groups (NHOH)</strong>: Impacts solubility and biological activity, especially in pharmaceutical compounds.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The web app provides a quick and efficient way to calculate these properties by uploading a CSV file containing SMILES notation. This tool significantly accelerates the drug design and molecular research process, allowing researchers to focus more on insights rather than computational tasks.</p>

        <h3>Impact on the Scientific Field:</h3>
        <p>By enabling rapid analysis of molecular properties, this web app can enhance the efficiency of drug discovery, material science, and molecular biology. The ability to assess key properties such as solubility, stability, and reactivity is crucial for developing effective pharmaceutical compounds and advanced materials. This tool empowers researchers to make data-driven decisions faster, thus potentially leading to breakthroughs in drug design and other molecular applications.</p>
